## Starting the project
The set up for the application is required to only have <b>Yarn</b> installed on your computer.

If you don't have it globally installed on the computer you can run the following code in 
your terminal: `npm install yarn -g`

If you do not have npm as recognised command on your computer you must install this first.

IF you have Yarn installed you can run following: `yarn install`

This will install all the needed packages in order to run the server in your browser.

Then run: `yarn start`

Open up a browser and enter following url: <b>localhost:8080</b>
