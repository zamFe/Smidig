## Starting the project locally
Main tools for build up of the application is trough node and yarn

If you do not have node or npm installed, go to this site in order to install it on your computer:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

The set up for the application is required to only have <b>Yarn</b> installed on your computer.

Link to yarn: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

If you don't have it globally installed on the computer you can run the following code in 
your terminal: `npm install yarn -g`

If you do not have npm as recognised command on your computer you must install this first.

IF you have Yarn installed you can run following: `yarn install`

This will install all the needed packages in order to run the server in your browser.

Then run: `yarn start`

Open up a browser and enter following url: <b>localhost:8080</b>
